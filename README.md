# RSS Aggregator

[English](README.md) | [中文](README-zh.md)

**Current version: 2.0.1** &nbsp;·&nbsp; `/healthz` reports it too.

A feature-rich, self-hosted RSS feed aggregator with scheduled fetching, OPML import/export, full-text extraction, search, email notifications, and a bilingual web interface. Ideal for personal or team use in information aggregation, content monitoring, and reading management.

## ✨ Features

### Core Features

- **RSS Source Management**: Add, delete, edit and pause RSS feeds with categories (e.g., "Tech", "News", "Blogs").
- **Scheduled Fetching**: Powered by APScheduler, each source can have its own update interval (minimum 5 minutes); paused sources are skipped.
- **Login protection**: Single-user sign-in with hashed passwords, session cookies hardened (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`) and a lockout after repeated failures. Off by default until you set a password.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy, with lightweight in-place migrations for existing databases.
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based responsive UI with English/Chinese language switching, plus global and per-feed unread counters.
- **Article Reading**: Displays title, summary, publish time, and links to the original article.

### Advanced Features

- **Retention policy**: Cap articles per feed or by age so a long-running instance does not grow without bound.
- **OPML Import/Export**: One-click migration of feed subscriptions, compatible with mainstream RSS readers.
- **Full-Text Extraction**: For sources that provide only summaries, attempts to extract the full article text using BeautifulSoup.
- **Keyword Filtering & Full-Text Search**: Search across title, summary, and content, with optional filtering by source and unread status.
- **Custom Update Frequency**: Each source can have its own fetch interval.
- **Email Notifications**: Configure SMTP to receive email alerts when new articles are fetched.
- **Docker Deployment**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml provided for easy deployment.

> **Security note**: since 2.0.1 the app ships with optional single-user authentication.
> Set `auth.password_hash` (or the `RSS_AGGREGATOR_PASSWORD` environment variable) before
> exposing it beyond your own network — without a password the UI is open to anyone who can reach it.

  # secret_key: "..."          # Optional; a random key is generated per start if absent

  # Relative SQLite paths are anchored to the project root, so this file is
  # <project>/data/rss.db locally and /app/data/rss.db in the container (mounted volume).
  url: "sqlite:///data/rss.db"
  # Example PostgreSQL: postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname

## 🧩 Usage

### Adding an RSS Source

On the home page, fill in the form:
- **Name**: A friendly name for the source.
- **URL**: The RSS or Atom feed URL.
- **Category**: Optional category, e.g., "News", "Tech".
- **Update Interval**: Minutes between automatic fetches (minimum 5).

Click submit; the source will be fetched immediately and then updated according to the interval.

### Searching and Filtering

Use the search bar at the top of the page:
- Enter keywords to search across title, summary, and full text.
- Optionally filter by a specific source.
- Check "Unread only" to see only unread articles.

### OPML Import/Export

- **Export**: Click "Export OPML" to download an XML file containing all your sources.
- **Import**: Click "Import OPML" and choose an OPML file; sources will be added automatically, preserving categories.

### Email Notifications

To receive email alerts when new articles are fetched:
1. Set `notifications.email.enabled` to `true` in `config.yaml`.
2. Fill in your SMTP server details and recipient addresses.
3. When a source is fetched (manually or scheduled) and new articles are found, an email will be sent.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will build the image and start the container in detached mode. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Data Persistence

The SQLite database is stored in the `./data` volume, and the configuration file is mounted read-only. To customize settings, edit `config.yaml` before starting.

### Custom Configuration

Override the default compose file if needed:

```yaml
services:
  rss:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```
